 fig 1: fancy ASCII art

 Shade is a neato programming language. Right now, it's basically C only trimmed down a bit. So, no type checking. That's up to you. A minimal, consistent syntax is a primary design goal for as long as is feasible/interesting. I started making this one day just to see if I could, but then it gradually turned into something useful. I'll right a longer README later when I have time, right now coding is more important.
